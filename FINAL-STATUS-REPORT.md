# MHM Project Tracker v3 - Authentication System Fixed & Ready for Netlify

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Corrupted security.js File**
- **Problem**: The security.js file was corrupted with duplicate content and syntax errors
- **Solution**: Completely recreated the file with a clean, modern authentication system using:
  - SHA-256 password hashing with salt
  - Session management with automatic expiration
  - Cross-tab session synchronization
  - Account lockout protection
  - Default admin account creation

### 2. **Multi-User Authentication System**
- **Problem**: Users couldn't create accounts that worked immediately on other devices
- **Solution**: Implemented robust UserManager class that:
  - Creates users instantly with proper password hashing
  - Manages sessions with automatic persistence
  - Supports admin and regular user roles
  - Provides secure session timeouts and cross-device sync

### 3. **Notification Spam Prevention**
- **Problem**: "User data synchronized" notifications were appearing repeatedly
- **Solution**: Implemented throttled sync system:
  - 5-second minimum between sync operations
  - Reduced notification frequency
  - Smart cross-tab communication without spam

### 4. **Admin Panel Functionality**
- **Problem**: Admin panel was broken due to corrupted security system
- **Solution**: Rebuilt admin panel with:
  - User creation and management
  - Role assignment (admin/user)
  - Password reset capabilities
  - User deletion (except admin)
  - Clean, responsive interface

## 🚀 How the Authentication System Works

### Default Login
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- The system automatically creates this default admin account if no users exist

### Creating New Users (Admin Only)
1. Login as admin
2. Click "Admin Panel" button
3. Click "+ Add User"
4. Fill in username, password, and role
5. User is created instantly and can login on any device immediately

### Session Management
- Sessions persist for 24 hours
- Auto-login when returning to the application
- Sessions sync across browser tabs
- Automatic logout when session expires

### Security Features
- SHA-256 password hashing with random salt
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute lockout)
- Minimum password length requirements
- Session timeout protection
- Cross-tab session synchronization
